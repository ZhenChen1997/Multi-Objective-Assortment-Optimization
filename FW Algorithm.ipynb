    "## <font size = 6> Introduction\n",
    "<font size = 5> This notebook implements and evaluates the **Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm** as a heuristic for solving the **multi-objective assortment optimization problem** (specifically, mean-variance trade-off) under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size = 5> The primary objective is to test the performance of this iterative heuristic against provably optimal solutions. The optimal solutions are assumed to have been pre-calculated (likely using the algorithm from the \"ICG Algorithm.ipynb\" file) and are loaded from external Excel files.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size = 5> The main contents are as follows:\n",
    "1. <font size = 5> **Define Key Functions**: In this section we implement the functions to calculate necessary MNL model metrics and the core logic of a single Frank-Wolfe iteration.\n",
    "2. <font size = 5> **Read Experimental Data**: We then read problem instance settings (revenues, attraction weights) and their corresponding known optimal solutions from a series of Excel files.\n",
    "3. <font size = 5> **Run FW Algorithm**: For each problem instance and for various risk-aversion coefficients (lambda), we run the iterative FW algorithm until it converges.\n",
    "4. <font size = 5> **Evaluation**: We finally compare the solutions found by the FW algorithm against the known optimal solutions to measure its correctness and performance. The results are then systematically saved to a new Excel files.\n"
