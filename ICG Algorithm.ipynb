        "**4. After obtaining all candidate assortments, we then work on identifying the efficient frontier of the given instance. The idea of the algorithm is given as follows:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we have already discussed the property of the efficient frontier (i.e., a pointwise maximum function of all lines $(-{\\sf Var}*\\lambda+{\\sf Rev})$, identifying efficient frontier is equivalent to identifying the upper envelope of all lines, each segment of which represents an candidate assortment. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then we note that all these lines can be converted to a point in the form of $(-{\\sf Var}, -{\\sf Rev})$ in the dual space, and the upper/lower envelope corresponds to the lower/upper convex hull of all converted points. The convex hull of a point set can be computed directly by using scipy library. \n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we just need to figure out which part of the convex hull belongs to the lower hull. Intuitively, we note that in the risk-sensitive case, our parameter $\\lambda$ increases from 0 to $+\\infty$, which implies that when $\\lambda = 0$, the line with maximum ${\\sf Rev}$ value is the uppermost line. Similarly, when $\\lambda\\rightarrow +\\infty$, the line with maximum ${\\sf -Var}$ value will be the uppermost line. After determining the start position and end position, we can quickly compute the efficient frontier (the ConvexHull function in scipy library includes all vertices of the convex hull in couterclock order in the 2-d plane). \n",
        "\n",
        "Besides, it is also worth noting that when computing the efficient frontier, if a segment of the efficient frontier intersects with x-axis, then the empty set becomes optimal after this intersection. So we compare the intersection of a line $L_k$ with the next line (i.e., the line which is adjcent in the list of lower hull vertices) with the root of $L_k$, if the root is smaller in x-coordinate, we break the loop and add 'empty set' as the last optimal assortment. Otherwise, we continue the loop. "
